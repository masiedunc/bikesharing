### Trips by Weekday per Hour
Diving deeper into how the Citi Bikes are used, we can display the number of trips per weekday and hour. While we found that the peak hours for riders in August 2019 were 7 am – 9 am and 5 pm - 7 pm, many riders, as seen in Figure 2, were utilizing the bikes during these times during the week rather than on the weekends (Saturday – Sunday).

### Trip Duration
Looking at the trip duration in the figure above it seems that most of the trips were a little less than 10 minutes and not much longer than 60 minutes. See Figure 3.

### Gender Breakdown
One key part of the data collected from NYC Citi Bikes was the breakdown of usage between genders. In Figure 4, you can visualize this breakdown- most riders seem to be male.

### Trips by Gender per Weekday
Revisiting the Trip Durations, we can break down this data by gender in Figure 5. It is noticeable that when the trip duration is broken down by gender, more men tend to take longer trips compared to women. However, overall duration seems to be similar between the genders.
